# The Garden Party and Dubliners: Punctuation is Style, Period.

When we read prose, the aspect that strikes us most about the author’s writing style is perhaps their use of structure, symbolism, or vocabulary. While these stylistic devices deserve the appreciation they duly receive, there is one very often overlooked aspect of writing style—punctuation. Even in quantitative analysis of written text, punctuation is discarded along with stop words because they introduce ‘noise’ into the analysis process. However, when we take a look at a sentence, and strip it of everything except punctuation, it might be able to tell us something about the author’s style. For example,

,,,.,—.,’’.,,,’.,

is what is left when my opening paragraph is ‘de-worded’. In isolation, it probably might not reveal much. However, when compared with the vast corpora available out there, there may be valuable information that we are consciously removing every time we perform textual analysis. Hence, in this paper, I aim to explore whether the properties of such punctuation sequences are a unique feature of different authors. In particular, I will be comparing the works of two modernist writers, The Garden Party and Other Stories by Katherine Mansfield and Dubliners by James Joyce. 

First, I conduct a normalized frequency analysis to look at the types of punctuation each author tends to use more frequently. Then, I attempt to attribute texts to the modernist authors in a stylometric analysis. Finally, I examine the sequence of punctuation in each work with individual heatmaps, and try to identify patterns or styles that the author favors, confirming, or disconfirming, my hypotheses.
